	"aka": "",
	"motivation": "When the amount or frequency of requests to prediction suddenly increases, it can outpace the velocity of scaling. Complete outages are to avoid",
	"solution": "It is reasonable to choose to cancel a certain number of request to stabilize the current prediction service, until the scale out completes to respond all the predictions.",
	"consequences": "Pros: Avoid complete outage of the service.\nIt allows to scale out prediction servers without lowering the current resource availability. Cons:Requires a fallback plan for cancelled requests.",

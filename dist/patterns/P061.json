	"motivation": "When the workflow can execute multiple predictions in parallel.\nWhen you want to integrate prediction results at last.\nRequired to run several predictions to one request",
	"solution": "Multiple are deployed models in parallel. You can send one request to the models at once to acquire multiple predictions, or an integrated prediciton.",
	"consequences": "Pros: You can tune resource usage independently and isolate failure.\nYou may develop model and system without having dependency on other models.                                Cons: The system may become complex.\nFor synchronous usecase, the slowest inference becomes bottleneck.\nFor asynchronous usecase, you have to let the postprocess to manage time lag between prediction latencies.",

	"aka": "Separation of Concerns, Multi-Tiered Architecture",
	"motivation": "An application comprises several groups of subtasks, each of which is at a different level of abstraction.",
	"solution": "Divide the application into different layers. Each layer, consisting of sub-modules, can be independently designed to feed into foreign prototypes. Each layer has an input and corresponding output to the succeeding layer. The succeeding return is used as a feed to the next layers for further processing. Every layer communicates only with its direct neighbor",
	"consequences": "This pattern enables inference of results at the individual steps. Extra components can be added or modified to meet the computational requirements giving it high flexibility.",

	"motivation": "You trained a new model with assumed better prediction quality, but it's not certain if this will carry over to production. Additionally, there could be other quality issues with the new model that should not affect all users in production at once.",
	"solution": "Deploy the new model in addition to the existing ones and route a small number of requests to it to evaluate its performance. If this test is successful, all existing models can be replaced. If not, the new model needs to be improved.",
	"consequences": "Only a small number of users are subjected to potential bugs or low-quality predictions. Additional serving and monitoring infrastructure is required.",

	"aka": "Cascade Predictions, Multiple stage prediction pattern",
	"motivation": "Executing large, complex models can be time-consuming and costly, especially if lightweight clients like mobile or IoT devices are involved.",
	"solution": "Split the prediction into two phases. A simple, fast model is executed first on the client. Afterwards, a large, complex model is optionally executed in the cloud for deeper insights.",
	"consequences": "Prediction response time is reduced for some cases. The number of large, expensive predictions is reduced. The client has a fall-back model when there is no Internet connection.",
	"examples": "Voice activation in AI assistants like Alexa or Google Assistant",

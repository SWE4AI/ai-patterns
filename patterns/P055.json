	"solution": "packs all the artifacts and code for the prediction model in a web server",
	"consequences": "Since the single server REST (or GRPC) interface, preprocess, and trained model are in one place, you can create and deploy them as a simple predictor.  Pros:  (1) Ability to use one programming language for the web server, preprocess and inference.\n(2) Easy to manage because of it's simplicity. (3) Easier troubleshooting.\n(4) Minimal time-to-production post model training.\nCons: (1) Since all components are packed in a server or a docker image, applying a small patch will require updating the whole image (2) Updates will also require a service deployment, which in bigger organizations requires one to follow a hefty SDLC",

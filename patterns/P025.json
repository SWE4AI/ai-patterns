	"aka": "",
	"motivation": "AI-based services are provided\ndirectly to downstream applications (e.g., e-commerce sites, trade orders), therefore coupling services and downstream applications tighter than needed.",
	"solution": "Define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. Instead of providing services directly, each service has to go through the mediator. The mediator may also perform checks or update widgets (e.g., deduplicate items).\nThis restricts direct communication between services.",
	"consequences": "Loose coupling between sub-systems.",

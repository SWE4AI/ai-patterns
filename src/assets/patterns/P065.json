	"consequences": "Pro: Quick response, and still eventual accuracy. Con:Multiple servers and interfaces needed",
	"examples": "For web applications, it is important to take a balance of speed and accuracy, and especially for interactive applications, it is possible to consider a usecase where you first return a quick prediction, and then add the better ones in the next screen or downward.",

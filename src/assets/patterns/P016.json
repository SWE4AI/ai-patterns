	"motivation": "Machine Learning (ML) systems are complex because their ML components must be (re)trained regularly and have an intrinsic non-deterministic behavior. Similar to other systems, the business requirements for these systems as well as ML algorithms change over time.",
	"solution": "Define clear APIs between traditional and\nML components. Place business and ML components with different responsibilities into three layers. Divide data flows into three.",
	"consequences": "Decoupling “traditional” business and ML components allows the ML components to be monitored and adjusted to meet users’ requirements and changing inputs.",

	"motivation": "When you have different code-base, library or resource load requirements for preprocess and prediction.\nWhen you want to separate preprocess with prediction to divide issue in each resource to improve availability",
	"solution": "divide preprocessing steps and the prediction model into separate resources",
	"consequences": "Pros: (1) Able to use resource efficiently with fault isolation.\n(2) Flexibility in resource usage and scalability.\n(3) Able to select library and language versions for each component.\nCons: (1) Increases operation cost with complexity in resources.\n(2) Network connection in between preprocess and prediction may become bottleneck.",

	"solution": "asynchronous approach\nPredictions are triggered and run asynchronisously either by the application or as a scheduled job. The predictions will be collected and stored — this is what the application uses to serve the predictions via a user interface.",
	"consequences": "pre-trained: yes\non-the-fly-predictions: no\n\nMany in industry have moved away from this architecture, but it’s much more forgiving in a sense that predictions can be inspected before being returned to a user. Therefore, we reduce the risk of our ML system making errors since predictions are not on the fly.",

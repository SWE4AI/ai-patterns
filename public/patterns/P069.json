	"motivation": "To control prediction with parameter.\nWhen it is possible to control rule-based.",
	"solution": "add a mechanism in your code to change behaviour of all or a part of the predictions, including stopping, retrying or timeout. Since it is difficult to keep high accuracy without any error for a model for every case or every input data, it is better to estimate possible anomaly and control with rulebased mechanism.",
	"consequences": "Pros: avoid abnormal prediction for edge cases.\nCons: Impossible to cover all the cases.\nIncrease in rules make complexity in operation.",

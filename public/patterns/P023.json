	"motivation": "Creating an end-to-end reproducible training and deployment pipeline for a machine learning component is difficult. Data science notebooks can run a whole pipeline, but they do not scale.",
	"solution": "Make each pipeline step a separate containerized service. Services are orchestrated and chained together to form pipelines that can be run via REST API calls.",
	"consequences": "The portability, scalability, and maintainability of the individual pipeline steps is improved, at the cost of an overall more complex solution.",

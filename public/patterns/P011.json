	"motivation": "Complex prediction or synthesis use cases are often difficult to accomplish with a single AI tool or model.",
	"solution": "Divide the problem into smaller consecutive steps, then combine several existing AI tools or custom models into an inference-time AI pipeline, where each specialized tool or model is responsible for a single step.",
	"consequences": "More tools and models need to be integrated, but the provided is result is of higher quality. Each step can be optimized individually.",
	"examples": "Typical computer vision inference pipelines as described in 126",
